[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) will be the first testing framework I will check out and document. This is the framework currently favoured by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/).

Testing criteria:
* Ease of use
    * To set up
	* To create tests
	* To run the tests
* Types of testing supported

    I'm currently thinking about Unit testing. What else can it be comfortably used with?
* What can be tested:
    * Basic testing
	* Call backs
	* Promises
* Support:
	* What documentation is available
	* Git activity
	* Stackoverflow
* Code coverage
